# Detailed Maps

This is a visual mod for **The Long Dark** by Hinterland Studios

Detailed Maps replaces the existing charcoal region maps in game with more detailed ones in order to make mapping a better use of time in-game and make navigation a bit easier. No more need to look up maps online!

Currently using maps from [Topographic Maps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1142193220) by delta, which I've filtered to look more charcoal-y.

# Planned improvements

Currently not all region maps are overhauled, so I indend to expand the number of maps impacted by the mod. I'm also hoping to eventually add options for the maps to be used, giving players more options to choose from. 

# Special Thanks

Thanks to DigitalZombie and Fuar for providing guidance (and letting me directly copy their code in Fuar's case), enabling me to make this mod!
